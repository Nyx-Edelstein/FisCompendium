<strong>Plan: Learn by Doing</strong>

<p>Link Actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Link ain't afraid of no ghost! Diplomacy might work on Ibosso.</li>
    <li>While en-route work with Fi to refine use of the Circular Stone Disk aoe detection, using the Transfabrulator as an example of something to detect. Also complete her own version of the same aoe effect, using at most 1000 VP to complete both items. Since Ibosso is such an old legend, there might be some more artifacts to find.</li>
    <li>If there's time, review the 3 combat manuals. Focus on if there are techniques that are unknown to Link and the trio. Plus if there's any instructions on using the Transfabrulator or fighting Stalfos/voidspawn. And anything on ghostbusting.</li>
    <li>Ask Fi if she thinks marking additional people will increase the cost of marking someone. If no, mark Koja because she's the healer. If yes, wait to mark whoever bonds with the power fragment. If maybe, spend 100 vp marking koja to get an estimate of how much it would cost. All assuming koja's willing to be marked.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Zelda Actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Naibi didn't know much about Ibosso, but are there other members of the tribe that know more about him? Maybe some elderly members?</li>
    <li>Try to listen in on the meeting between Taetus and Shesan. If they rip into each other, it might be entertaining and if your two least favorite people in the world, Hylia forbid, <em>get along</em> that's good to know as well.</li>
    <li>Resume the regular meetings with the Council. Inform them that thanks to the blessings she received from Hylia, Link was initiated into the Lightsworn. Spreading this news would hopefully improve the country's morale (and it's going to spread anyway since everyone in her traveling party knows it happened). How should she best announce it?</li>
    <li>Once back in Castletown, arrange to meet with Vestele in person, because of the sensitive nature, to request that the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using Sacrifice for power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself and harm Hyrule. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP. Shesan also claimed that the Niesis <em>incident</em> released sealed Fae, so they might want to be on the look out for active Fae too. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?</li>
    <li>If the Zora members of the Order of Sages (or other Zora) are willing and able, have them give Zelda a crash course on speaking the Zora language. Mainly for Fi to understand the language. Read them in on Fi's existence and her language ability if needed to convince them.</li>
    <li>When some blin have been captured, they might talk to each other if confined together. Zelda and Fi can listen in to learn the blin language. If her advisors have other ideas about how to get blin prisoners to talk, that would be lovely.</li>
    <li>Ask Lensa for her help in getting a short list of suitable consorts. Besides Link.</li>
